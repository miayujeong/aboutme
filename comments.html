        <h3>Reflection on overall design</h3>
        <p>
          Overall, I made an effort to ensure that every page on this website
          provides a sense of unity for users. I used similar structure
          including the same top navigation bar across all pages and limited the
          color palette, including the background color. Additionally, elements
          have been added to assist diabled user exploring the website.

        <h3>Technical aspects on my website</h3>
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <p>
          All pages of this website has a common structure: a top navigation
          bar, a header (except for the index page), contents, and a footer.
          These individual elements are styled separately using
          <a class="names">&lt;div&gt;</a> tags.
        </p>
        <h4>Top naviation bars</h4>
        <p>
          Pages of this website can be navigated through the navigation bar.
          Each item uses the <a class="names">&lt;a&gt;</a> tag to possess the
          link to other page. They are set style for the hover state using
          <a class="names">:hover</a> property.
        </p>
        <h4>Parallel columns</h4>
        <p>
          Exploring
          <a class="link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"
            >W3cschool</a
          >
          website, I learned how to make webpage with equal or unequal columns.
          This structure is applied to the
          <a class="link" href="index.html">INDEX</a> and the
          <a class="link" href="future.html">FUTURE</a> page. On both page,
          there is a parent element that wraps columns which has
          <a class="names">flex</a> display property. And each child element,
          erving as individual columns, has its width set. Then, clear any
          whitespace with <a class="names">:after</a> property.
        </p>
        <pre>
.future-img {
            display: flex;
                      
            .col.left {
              width: 45%;
            }
          
            .col.right {
              width: 55%;
            }

            .future-img:after {
              content: "";
              display: table;
              clear: both;
            }
          }</pre
        >

        <h4>CSS selectors: class</h4>
        <p>
          I used class for objects I might reuse again. One instance is the
          images on the <a class="link" href="past.html">PAST</a> page. I used
          <a class="names">class="small-img"</a> for every image here, to apply
          same style (round border and size) more effectively.
        </p>
        <pre>
.small-img {
        border-radius: 20%;
        height: 150px;
      }</pre
        >
        <p>
          Some elements could not be reused wholly as they have both repeating
          and changing parts. For example, in the content section of the on the
          <a class="link" href="future.html">FUTURE</a> page, the upper area has
          photo on its left, while the lower area has it on the right. In this
          case, I used class names with spaces to apply common styles for the
          larger class and then set specific styles for each individual classes.
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;div class="future-img left"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="future-img right"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/div&gt;</pre
        >
        <p></p>
        <pre>
.future-img {
          display: flex;
          ...      
        }
        
.future-img.left {
          ...
        }
        
.future-img.right {
          ...
        }</pre
        >
        <h4>CSS selectors: id</h4>
        <p>
          I used id for appling style to that specific object. One example is
          the table on the <a class="link" href="past.html">PAST</a> page. I
          used <a class="names">id="past-table"</a> for the table, and collected
          all styles and classes that are specifically used for styling this
          table.
        </p>
        <pre>
#past-table {
        ...
      
        th,
        td {
          ...
        }
      
        .img_col {
          ...
        }
      
        .dates {
          ...
        }
      
        .detail1 {
          ...
        }
      
        .detail2 {
          ...
        }
      }</pre
        >

        <h3>Aesthetics of my website</h3>
        <h4>Color scheme</h4>
        <p>
          I primarily used navy blue, light sky blue, and light gray across all
          pages. This color scheme was chosen to create a professional
          impression of an IT industry.
        </p>
        <h4>Layout</h4>
        <p>
          At the very top of each page is a navigatio bar, allowing users to
          easily navigate to their desired page. Except for the index page,
          every page has a header section at the top, making it easy for users
          to notice which page they are currently viewing.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the PAST page, I used a table to organize my experiences in a
          consistent format. On the left side, there is a simple image related
          to the activity, and on the right side, details are listed in a
          uniform order and style. This structure allows users to quickly
          understand the content without additional explanations.
        </p>
        <h4>Consistency</h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, this website provides a sense of consistency
          through a common layout and color palette across all pages. Each page
          has the same navigation bar in the same position, with the contents
          below and a footer centered at the very bottom. Additionally, the
          title and an icon appears next to it maintain the same format, also
          contributing to the uniformity of the website overall.
        </p>
        <h4>Readability</h4>
        <p>
          By leaving sufficient white spaces between elements on each page, I
          ensured the readability of the website. The space between a paragraph
          and next heading is larger than the space between regular paragraphs,
          to indicate the difference in semantic. The
          <a class="link" href="index.html">INDEX</a> page has more whitespace
          than COMMENT page, which is because they are distinct in contents.
          While the COMMENT page contains a lot of texts and technical
          information, the <a class="link" href="index.html">INDEX</a> page is
          lighter and intended to be the first landing page for users.Therefore,
          I added more space on the INDEX page to create a less overwhelming and
          more comfortable feeling for users.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility aspects of my website</h3>
        <h4>ALT</h4>
        <p>
          All images on this website inculde alternative text to help disabled
          users who access the website only through screen readers. For example,
          the mimoji profile image on the
          <a class="link" href="index.html">INDEX</a> page contains the
          following alternative text:
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;img src="..." alt="profile image" /&gt;</pre>
        <h4>Color contrast</h4>
        <p>
          I avoided using low-contrasted colors for users who have low vision. I
          checked the color contrast of main colors I used in this website
          through
          <a
            class="link"
            href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/"
            target="_blank"
          >
            WebAIM Contrast Checker </a
          >, to make sure that they have enough contrast ratio.
        </p>
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <p>
          All contents in this website fit into the logical structure by using
          heading tags for heading texts. Also, they follow a meaningful order,
          which aids screen readers in navigating the website more smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the navigation bar is created using
          <a class="names">&lt;ul&gt;</a> and
          <a class="names">&lt;li&gt;</a> tags to indicate its semantic as the
          list of links to screen readers.
        </p>
        <h4>Links</h4>
        <p>
          The hyperlinks in this website are recognizable compared to plain text
          by different color. I used <a class="names">link</a> class to apply
          distinct color style (blue) to texts that serves as a hyperlink.
        </p>
        <pre>
.link {
          color: #006a95;
          text-decoration: none;
        }</pre
        >
        <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
        <p>
          By limiting the max width of paragraph or the table, it is made sure
          that the line lengths of paragraphs in this website are not too long.
